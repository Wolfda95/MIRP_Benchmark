# Inference Scripts Overview

This directory contains inference scripts for four different models, each executed via separate scripts. While the overall structure of these scripts is largely identical, model-specific commands vary accordingly.

## Dependencies

In addition to standard Python packages (`os`, `sys`, `json`, `random`, `time`, `torch`), some scripts require additional model-specific dependencies, e.g. `openai`, `vllm`, `transformers`

## Documentation

Each inference script includes a **detailed docstring** with relevant information, such as required dependencies and further instructions. Additionally, all scripts are extensively documented with **comments, docstrings, and descriptions** to ensure clarity and usability.
